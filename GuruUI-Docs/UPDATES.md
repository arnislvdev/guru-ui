# Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to reflect the major performance optimizations and new architecture of Guru UI v0.1.21.

## Key Changes

### Performance Improvements
- **Bundle Size Reduced**: From ~15KB to 9.1KB gzipped (39% reduction)
- **Framework Optimization**: 
  - React: 1.0KB gzipped
  - Vue: 263 bytes gzipped  
  - Vanilla: 400 bytes gzipped
- **Core Logic**: 418 bytes gzipped shared across all frameworks
- **Tree-shaking Ratio**: 39.4% (excellent optimization)

### Architecture Enhancements
- **16 Fully Implemented Cores**: Complete core components with shared logic
- **BaseCore System**: Shared utilities and accessibility features
- **CSS Variable Standardization**: All variables now use `--guru-*` prefix
- **Enhanced Class Generation**: `createComponentClasses` utility for consistency
- **Optimized Build Process**: Better tree-shaking and bundle splitting

### New Features
- **Enhanced Utilities**: `cn` utility with `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` integration
- **Shared Types**: Centralized TypeScript types for better consistency
- **Benchmark Script**: Built-in performance monitoring
- **Post-build Processing**: Automated asset optimization
